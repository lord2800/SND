# SND Scripts

This is my collection of scripts and stuff. It may or may not be useful to you.

## To use (old instructions):

1. Set up SomethingNeedDoing. I will not elaborate on this.
2. Clone this repo somewhere.
3. SomethingNeedDoing -> Help -> Options -> Lua -> Add this cloned repo path as a lua required path.
4. Copy the script you want to use into a new SND macro, make sure to pick Lua as the language.
5. Hit run.
